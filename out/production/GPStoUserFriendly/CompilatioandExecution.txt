1.  Go the project root.

2.  GPSEmulator.java actually sends emulated GPS data, sentence-by-sentence which can be read and recievied by NMEA0183Display.java

3.  FrameSendEmulator.java sends emulated GPS data, byte-by-byte which can be read and recieved by FrameGetDisplay.java, byte-by-byte.
4.  FrameGetDisplay.java also verifies the checksum, and it is anti-spoof, as if the distance between the given coordinates and
    previous coordinates is greater than 8000 km (can be changed), it will display it as invalid.

5.  Compilation - javac -cp "lib/*" src/program_name.java
6.  Execution - java -cp "lib/*;src" program_name

7.  I have used a virtual serial port as the channel of communication.
